# Description:   YAML configuration file for the CloudFlare DDNS Agent
# Notes:         1. There's clearly a potential vulnerability should the below IP resolver service be
#                   compromised. You can change this to point at a self-hosted service if necessary or
#                   I'll host a secure public resolver for this purpose if requested (via GitHub).
